develop the task management application:

Front-End:
UI Implementation:

Start by setting up your front-end environment using a framework like React.js, which is ideal for building component-based applications.
Use the provided mock designs to build the UI. Ensure the design is responsive and user-friendly.
Drag-and-Drop: Utilize a library like react-beautiful-dnd or react-dnd to implement the drag-and-drop functionality for tasks between columns.
Routing: Set up routing using react-router-dom to navigate between different pages (e.g., login, dashboard).
Authentication:

Use libraries like Firebase or Auth0 to handle authentication, including Google login.
Secure each route by ensuring authentication is required to access any page other than the login/signup page.
Back-End:
Framework Setup:

Set up a Node.js environment and install Express.js to build your backend.
Set up a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for tasks and user management.
Data Storage:

Choose a database: Use MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL/MySQL (SQL) based on your preference or project requirements.
Create models for User and Task. A Task should include properties like title, description, status (which column it belongs to), and userId (to associate tasks with a user).
API Development:

Implement routes for user registration, login, and Google authentication.
Create routes for tasks: GET /tasks, POST /tasks, PUT /tasks/:id, and DELETE /tasks/:id.
Ensure tasks are only accessible by the authenticated user.
Validation and Error Handling:

Use libraries like Joi or express-validator for validating request data.
Implement comprehensive error handling, sending meaningful error messages to the client with appropriate HTTP status codes.
Testing:
Write unit tests for critical API endpoints using a testing framework like Jest.
Ensure the tests cover key scenarios, such as successful task creation, invalid data submission, and unauthorized access.
Security:
Implement basic security measures:
Use HTTPS for secure communication.
Implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
Protect against SQL/NoSQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.
